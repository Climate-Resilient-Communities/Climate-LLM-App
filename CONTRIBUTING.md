# Contributing to Climate LLM App

We welcome contributions to the Climate LLM App project. This document provides guidelines and instructions for contributing.

## Getting Started

Before you begin, make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free) and that you're familiar with basic GitHub workflows.

### Reporting Issues

- Check the issue tracker to ensure the issue hasn't already been reported.
- If it's a new issue, create a new issue and provide as much relevant information as possible.
- Include steps to reproduce the issue, the expected outcome, and the actual outcome.

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

To contribute to the Climate LLM App, you'll need to set up your development environment. This guide will help you get started.

#### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Git**: For version control.
- **Docker** (optional): If you're using containerization.
- **Python 3.x**: As our primary programming language (adjust this based on your tech stack).
- **Node.js** (if developing a web interface or working with JavaScript).

#### Fork and Clone the Repository

1. Fork the `Climate-LLM-App` repository on GitHub to your account.
2. Clone your fork to your local machine:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Climate-LLM-App.git

3.Change into the project directory:
  cd Climate-LLM-App

## Set Up the Project

### Python Environment (if applicable):

1. **Create a virtual environment:**

    ```sh
    python3 -m venv venv
    ```

2. **Activate the virtual environment:**
   - On Windows:
   
     ```cmd
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   
   - On Unix or MacOS:
   
     ```sh
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**

    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Node.js Environment (if applicable):

- **Install project dependencies:**

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

### Set Environment Variables:

- Create a `.env` file in the root of the project to store environment variables such as API keys, database URLs, etc. Ensure this file is listed in your `.gitignore` to avoid exposing sensitive information.

### Run the Application Locally:

- Follow the instructions specific to your project to start the development server. For example, if using Flask for a Python project:

    ```sh
    flask run
    ```

- If using Node.js, you might run:

    ```sh
    npm start
    ```

### Next Steps

After setting up your environment, you're ready to start contributing! Remember to keep your fork in sync with the main repository by regularly pulling in changes.


### Making Changes

- Create a new branch for your work:

  ```sh
  git checkout -b feature/your-new-feature

### Making Changes

- Make your changes in your branch, adhering to the coding standards and guidelines provided below.

### Coding Standards

- Write clean, maintainable, and idiomatic code.
- Include comments in your code where necessary.
- Follow the naming conventions and code structure already in place.

### Submitting Pull Requests
